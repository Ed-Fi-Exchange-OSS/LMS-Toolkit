# FIZZ-16: Extract login and access data for students in Canvas LMS

## Goal

### Story

As a school district, I want to know if the student engaged with my Canvas
LMS and/or a particular course on a particular school day

### Acceptance Criteria

A capture of these data points, or an assessment that these are not available

1. If a student logged into Canvas on a particular school day
1. A metric of either how long the student was logged in or how many Canvas
   resources (courses, assignments or other system entity) were accessed by a
   student on a particular day
1. If a student logged into a particular Canvas course on a particular school
   day
1. A metric of either how long the student was logged in to a course or how many
   Canvas resources in that course the student accessed on a particular day

## Getting Started

1. In the /explorations-py folder, run poetry install.
2. Select the generated virtual environment as interpreter in the notebook. In VSCode you only have to click the python version in the upper right corner, and it should show the option for selecting the virtual environment.
3. Copy the .env.example file to .example and set its values to the ones corresponding to your environment.
4. When opening the notebook in VSCode, you could see a message asking you to install some dependencies, you should install them.
5. Run the code.
