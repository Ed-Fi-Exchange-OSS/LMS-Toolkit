# LMS-Toolkit

The goal is to provide access to guidance, pointers to tools, and peer
bench-marking possibilities for school districts to get to the data they need
from instructional systems, especially in order to monitor the progress and
participation of students in virtual or blended models.

Systems](https://techdocs.ed-fi.org/display/ETKB/COVID-19+-+Data+Out+from+Instructional+Systems)
in Tech Docs.

## Tools

The current set of directories contain sample input data for loading into LMS's
as well as exploratory code. These are not necessarily polished tools. The code
supporting this project will evolve continuously, and this readme will be
updated as tools become formalized.
