# edfi-sql-adapter

Lightweight wrapper to facilitate connections to SQL databases.

## Developer Notes

This package is light on unit tests, because the functions are well tested from
an integration perspective. Would be nice to add unit tests for error handling
in particular, but that would mean a lot of mocking of SQLAlchemy.
